      I like to stay with a framework long enough to really know its strengths and weaknesses, and to build things that are not just shiny, but solid. 

      <br /><br />
      So far, my favourite combination is Symfony, Hotwire, Mercure and Tailwind CSS.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of coding, I love spending time in the mountains â€” climbing, hiking, or just being outdoors.
